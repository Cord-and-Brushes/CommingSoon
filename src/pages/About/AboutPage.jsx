                    Greetings,
                    <br />
                    <br /> I'm Kalpana Mahanti, an Artist/Art instructor and the
                    Founder of Cord & Brushes. Despite starting my career in
                    software engineering after completing my B.Tech, my passion
                    for art has always been present since childhood. Though I
                    had to set it aside for studies and work, the pandemic
                    provided me with the opportunity to reconnect with my
                    artistic side while working from home.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    During the lockdown, with limited art supplies, I resorted
                    to basic DIY projects, reigniting my love for art. In
                    September 2022, I took the leap, leaving my IT job to
                    establish Cord & Brushes, a virtual venture on social media,
                    alongside my brother Abhishek Mahanti (Co-Founder of Cord &
                    Brushes). The response has been overwhelming, allowing us to
                    offer workshops on various art forms at affordable prices,
                    making art education accessible to all.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Our mission is simple: to provide quality art education to
                    everyone, ensuring that anyone with a desire to learn can
                    pursue their passion without financial constraints.
                    <br />
                    <br /> I owe this achievement to the unwavering support of
                    Abhishek Mahanti (Brother), Sanjib Mahapatra (Husband),
                    Parents, Friends, and Family, whose love and encouragement
                    have been constant pillars of strength.
                    <br />
